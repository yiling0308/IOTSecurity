# IoT Attack Surface Areas

## The OWASP IoT Attack Surface Areas (DRAFT) are as follows:

>> ## Ecosystem Access Control
>- Implicit trust between components
>- Enrollment security
>-  Decommissioning system
>-  Lost access procedures

>> ## Device Memory
>- Cleartext usernames
>- Cleartext passwords
>- Third-party credentials
>- Encryption keys

>> ## Device Physical Interfaces	
>- Firmware extraction
>- User CLI
>- Admin CLI
>- Privilege escalation
>- Reset to insecure state
>- Removal of storage media

>> ## Device Web Interface	
>- SQL injection
>- Cross-site scripting
>- Cross-site Request Forgery
>- Username enumeration
>- Weak passwords
>- Account lockout
>- Known default credentials

>> ## Device Firmware	
>- Hardcoded credentials
>- Sensitive information disclosure
>- Sensitive URL disclosure
>- Encryption keys
>- Firmware version display and/or last update date

>> ## Device Network Services
>- Information disclosure
>- User CLI
>- Administrative CLI
>- Injection
>- Denial of Service
>- Unencrypted Services
>- Poorly implemented encryption
>- Test/Development Services
>- Buffer Overflow
>- UPnP
>- Vulnerable UDP Services
>- DoS

>> ## Administrative Interface
>- SQL injection
>- Cross-site scripting
>- Cross-site Request Forgery
>- Username enumeration
>- Weak passwords
>- Account lockout
>- Known default credentials
>- Security/encryption options
>- Logging options
>- Two-factor authentication
>- Inability to wipe device

>> ## Local Data Storage
>- Unencrypted data
>- Data encrypted with discovered keys
>- Lack of data integrity checks

>> ## Cloud Web Interface
>- SQL injection
>- Cross-site scripting
>- Cross-site Request Forgery
>- Username enumeration
>- Weak passwords
>- Account lockout
>- Known default credentials
>- Transport encryption
>- Insecure password recovery mechanism
>- Two-factor authentication

>> ## hird-party Backend APIs

>- Device information leaked
>- Location leaked

>> ## Update Mechanism	
>- Update sent without encryption
>- Updates not signed
>- Update location writable
>- Update verification
>- Malicious update
>- Missing update mechanism
>- No manual update mechanism

>> ## Mobile Application
>- Implicitly trusted by device or cloud
>- Username enumeration
>- Account lockout
>- Known default credentials
>- Weak passwords
>- Insecure data storage
>- Transport encryption
>- Insecure password recovery mechanism
>- Two-factor authentication

>> ## Vendor Backend APIs
>- Inherent trust of cloud or mobile application
>- Weak authentication
>- Weak access controls
>- Injection attacks

>> ## Ecosystem Communication
>- Health checks
>- Heartbeats
>- Ecosystem commands
